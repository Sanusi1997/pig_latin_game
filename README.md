 Pig Latin
Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on words. To make the Pig Latin form of an
English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an
“ay” is affixed. Specifically the game follows two rules:
(a) If a word begins with a vowel, “yay” is appended to the end of the word.
(b) If a word begins with a consonant, all the consonants from the beginning
up to the first vowel are removed and appended to the removed characters. Finally,they are then appended to “ay”
For example:
 dog ⇒ ogday
 scratch ⇒ atchscray
 is ⇒ isyay
 apple ⇒ appleyay
